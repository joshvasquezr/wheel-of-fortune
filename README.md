# The Wheel of Fortune
## Project Overview
The Wheel of Fortune project aims to provide a playable version of the popular game show, the Wheel of Fortune. This program is executed through an interactive command-line user interface. 

The user is prompted with a hidden phrase which they are to attempt to guess, one letter at a time. The user is also granted three life-lines to get a letter wrong. The user WINS by successfully uncovering the phrase before they exhaust their three life-lines. The user will LOSE if they use up their three life-lines before the phrase if fully uncovered.
